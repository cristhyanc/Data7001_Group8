Administration
* Agreed to now meet twice per week. Will start Monday morning 09:00 in addition to ongoing Wednesday evening 20:00. Will adjust as necessary to work around availability of all team members. Noted there may be a need to increase again in final couple of weeks as we sprint to the finish line. Let's keep this in mind as we get towards that point.
* Agreed to use GitHub as a central repository for sharing/version controlling code, data, and other stuff such as deliverables-in-progress e.g. reports.

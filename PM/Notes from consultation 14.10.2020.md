**Consultation with Professor Shazia Sadiq and Dr Thomas Taimre via Zoom 14/10/2020**

* No need to build a predictive model for this project. 

* (The project is intended to be more about the data science process. Draw out the insights. Do the storytelling)

* It is fine to get data use statistical techniques for explanation only.

* They would like to see our model. (In the report.)

* But pay attention to whether the model is fit for use. (E.g. assumptions on residuals in linear regression should be satisfied.)

* No page limit as such. But "keep it crisp".

* In response to question about linear regression versus logistic regression: We have dollar values (capital expenditure) so it is natural to do linear regression rather than logarithmic. Logarithmic would be throwing away some data, and would need to justify some threshold. But, yes, we might need to do logarithmic if we do not get statistical significance with logistic. We can also consider transforms - in particular, logarithm often works well when a variable is money.

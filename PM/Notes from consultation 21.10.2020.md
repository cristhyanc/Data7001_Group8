**Consultation with Professor Shazia Sadiq and Dr Thomas Taimre via Zoom 21/10/2020**

Question: We have found some funny correlations with electoral status and
spending such as with form of transport used to get to work. Should we simply
argue that they are the result of looking at many variables and spurious?

Answer: Maybe. Spurious correlations do occur: true phenomenon. But don't too
readily dismiss such findings. If you get  good p-value then you have "found
something". Look a bit closer. Suggestion: do a visualisation of correlation
matrix using R ggcorrplot or something along those lines; would be good for
report and/or presentation.

Question: We are planning to record entire presentation ahead of time into a PowerPoint
presentation with integrated slide-by-slide audio clips and integrated video of
live demonstration, or a single compiled mp4 video or similar. Will there be any
problem with this on the day from a technology perspective? Can we just have one
team member share their screen on the Zoom call and hit play?

Answer: No problem. Good idea to do this.

Question: We want to do a quick live demonstartaion immediately after our intorduction to
build some audience engagement. This will be somewhat of a deviation from the
data science process-based structure that we are following generally. Does this
sound like an okay idea?

Answer: No problem. Good idea to do this: would be making use of the inverted
pyramid technique
